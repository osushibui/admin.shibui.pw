It uses libraries such as Flask for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

You may notice that some of this code (especially the early one) is not too great. This is because this is a learning trip for me.
I am using a lot of libraries and concepts that are new to me and it's the first time I'm doing them.
This may be reflected in the quality of the code. I will try to fix up or replace some of the old code when I'm satisfied with the feature set.

**KEEP IN MIND THIS IS VERY EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS. THERE ARE A LOT OF FEATURES MISSING OR NOT WORKING.**

# What works
